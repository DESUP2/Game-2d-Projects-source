Stunning Results via Groundbreaking Technology
Creature will make you rethink how 2D animation is done. At the heart of Creature lies the Directable Automated Animation Engine, an incredibly powerful technology that allows you to produce motion you might not thought had been possible with traditional skeletal animation software. Creature offers traditional tools like FK and IK chains for animation and then expands beyond that to offer you some very advanced tools: Physics Bend Motors, Automated Walk Cycle Generation, Directable Flesh/Muscle/Soft Body Dynamics, Advanced Intelligent Bone Weighting, 2D Motion Capture and much more.
Your art ready for the world.
Creature exports animation in multiple file formats ready to plug into your content. Easily export your animation into image sequences, sprite sheets, movie files and FBX. For additional power and flexibility, Creature allows the export of your animations into Creature's custom JSON format. We provide Source Code for the Runtimes of most major Game Toolkits to read in and display the animations in your own work.
